# US Campaign Finance Analytics 

## Introduction
The federal government's influence on American political campaigns and elections has steadily increased over the past five decades. Although states primarily administer elections, the federal government plays a significant role in campaign finance regulation. With the US Presidential Election being a critical event impacting both local and global economies, there is a growing need for research on political events' effects on competitive local markets and the global economy. Consequently, various academics and politicians in the US have focused on forecasting election results to inform policy development.

## Abstract
Elections and campaigns are distinct processes governed differently, with the federal government having limited control over political campaigns, except for campaign funding. The main objectives of current election campaigns and policies are voter turnout and electioneering, regulated by federal laws defining permissible and prohibited sources of contributions and expenditures, contribution limits, fundraising prohibitions, permissible uses of campaign funds, and public disclosure of contributions and expenditures.

# Data Source and Methodology

## Data Source
The US Campaign Finance Data provided by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) serves as the primary data source for this project. This dataset encompasses information on candidates, committees, political action committees (PACs), campaigns, transactions, contributions, and expenditures related to US elections.
